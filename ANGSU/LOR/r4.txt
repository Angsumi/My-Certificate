Dear RECIPIENT NAME,
 
It is with great pleasure that I give my recommendation for Name in his bid to apply for Law School. One of my star students in Bachelors in Law, he has shown great interest and interest in different social science fields. He is particularly keen on political science and has maintained a solid GPA in his pre-law classes. 
 
His academic performance is consistent and has been highlighted by his extracurricular activities, which include debate, editorial writing, and involvement with the Young Leaders Association. He showed that he is more than capable of succeeding in whatever field he chooses, including going to law school.
 
Name demonstrates qualities that align with the motto of the school, which will make him successful in his endeavor. However, it is his compassion towards others that will make him a great practitioner of the law.
