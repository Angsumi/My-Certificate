Dear Jane Smith,
 
I am writing this letter as a recommendation for James Alcott.
 
I would like to recommend the candidature of James, without any reservation, for the position of HR Executive at your company. He is a remarkable professional with whom I have had the opportunity to work with. He is a natural leader and an expert in his trade. He leads by example and his colleagues look up to him for unconditional professional support and guidance. He is very composed and handles demanding situations very deftly. He is a reliable & bankable resource. He can wear multiple hats when the need arises. 
 
I firmly believe that James will surely prove to be an asset to your company, Label Inc.. Please feel free to reach out to me in case you need any additional information or detail. I will be happy to be of any help.
 
Regards,
