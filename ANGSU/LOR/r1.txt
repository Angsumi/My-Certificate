Dear Mrs.  Dane
 
Joanna is a phenomenal young student. I have supervised him closely. I have been witness to her academic achievements from close quarters. I have been informed that Joanna is applying for a specialized program at your institution and in the same regards, I recommend Joanna for the program.
 
Joanna has excelled in academics throughout her school. She is respected by her schoolmates. The teachers at the school see her as a model student. She leads from the front in any group activity. Joanna has represented her school at the state level in a robotics competition. 
 
Joanna is a perfect fit for the program launched by your school and I can say without any doubt that she will ace the program.  
 
Regards,
 
Delton Morre
