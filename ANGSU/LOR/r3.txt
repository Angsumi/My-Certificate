Dear To whom in concern,
 
I am delighted to write this letter for the sake of my longtime friend Susan who just applied to migrate to our state.
 
My name is Angsuman Das and it's been a genuine privilege to know Susan for the longest time. I reckon her a decent businessperson and outstanding friend. Through her kindness, she gladly accommodated me while staying in her country and treated me like family during my entire stay for business purposes.
 
Susan is a genuine, reliable, peaceful, and careful person. It is an outstanding honor for me to know her and regard it as an advantage to be her friend. 
 
Our family fully supports, in all possible ways, Susanâ€™s immigration application. She is a woman with outstanding honesty, passionate loyalty, a powerful quality, and cordial and amiable disposition. I can not think of a finer addition to this great country.
 
Regards,
 
Angsuman Das
